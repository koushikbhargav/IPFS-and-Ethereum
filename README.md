# IPFS-and-Ethereum

A protocol which allows independent nodes to share data directly to de- sired destinations without need of any central agency. It integrates IPFS distributed hypermedia protocol and Ethereum to en- able complete decentralization. The vision of this project is to develop a fully decentralized internet leveraging the full potential of Blockchain Technology.

The global daily data generation is estimated to be more than 2.5 quintillion bytes and more than 90 per cent of the total data produced is generated in the last two years. Most of this data is produced through various sources such as Search Platforms, Social Media, Data Sharing Platforms and E-Commerce. The third-party entities which provide these services often have great control over the data produced. This caused a lot of issues including data manipulation, lack of privacy and data leaks historically and is not just limited to the fields mentioned. The Facebook - Cambridge Analytica Scandal is a great instance for this problem. Peer to Peer networks partly solve this problem but are prone to several security vulnerabilities. The motivation behind this project is to eliminate the centralized agencies and to promote a fully decentralized and secure file system which can create a transparent and secure Internet.
